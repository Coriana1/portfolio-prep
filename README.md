Codetry (like poetry but code) 

## A personal headline, like you have atop your LinkedIn page. What do you want your career to be about?
Passionate Full stack developer ready to make life easier for you with every click. 

## Personal Pitch
I am a soon to be full stack software developer with a Navy Human Resource background. I worked I.T. for a year before joining Code Fellow because I wanted to be the mastermind behind the "why" and "how". I've always wanted to be apart of the team of individuals who come together to make web browsing, applications, and so much more so stressless, accessible, and eye catching. I hope to gain the knowledge and patience needed to being a diligent and vital developer that brings new ideas to the table but with solution and confidence. 

## What excites you the most about tech? Write 1-2 sentences
The possibilities are endless with tech, there is always a new and better/easier way of doing thing to make someone life that much simpler. Plus technology is always evolving so I won't get bored, rather I can get passionate about something else within the community if I want to expand on something else.
